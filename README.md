Code tree for GitHub
Thanks to Buu Nguyen and his team https://github.com/ovity/octotree/graphs/contributors
Octotree extension was released and serve well many years to all developers across the world. 

Recently black-theme feature that initially was free in v2 became pro feature in v3.

And in mind about childrens and hardworkers who will read github late at night and have to burn the eyes in case of not proper room light.

Using opensource nature releasing this fork of Octotree v2 branch and will name it Octo-Free. Will try to add nice feature that possibly will be compartible with original Octotree-v3 version.
